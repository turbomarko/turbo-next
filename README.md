## Development

First, run the development server:

```bash
# Build dev
# Note: Keep v1 command until "Use Docker Compose v2" is enabled by default for Docker Desktop for Linux
# Docker aliases `docker-compose` (v1 command) to `docker compose` (v2 command), but not the other way around
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml build

# Up dev
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Production

Multistage builds are highly recommended in production. Combined with the Next [Output Standalone](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/output-file-tracing#automatically-copying-traced-files) feature, only `node_modules` files required for production are copied into the final Docker image.

First, run the production server (Final image approximately 110 MB).

```bash
# Build prod
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml build

# Up prod in detached mode
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
